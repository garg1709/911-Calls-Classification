# 911-Calls-Classification
This notebook focuses on data classification of 911 calls received in Montgomery County, PA based on the incident type such as Fire, Traffic, EMS and many 
other factors.
The dataset used in this notebook is obtained from Kaggle and the link for the same is - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert
This notebook makes use of various Python libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. I have tried performing basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and this can
be very useful for someone who is just starting out in their Data Analyst/Data Scientist career.
Feel free to use this notebook at your own discretion.
Thanks for reading. :)
